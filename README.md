# Number Guessing Game Python

## This is...
... [a project I made for Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)

Actually, this supposed to be a **simple** CLI-based programmy thing.  

However...  
I found this idea a **little** boring so I decided to make it with a [GUI](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Insurrection)  

## Features

The game generates a random number between `ten` and `ninety-nine`, you have to guess it.

This game contains several features such as:

* `Tkinter` based `Grafical User Interface`
* An asymetrical main menu (I am not fixing it)
* Different difficulty levels (`Easy-Medium-Hard`)
* Different types of hints to choose from
* Timer with the custom time option
* Chronometer

### Difficulty Levels
Different difficulty levels grant different amounts of trials. Here's the list:
- Easy: `20`
- Medium: `15`
- Hard: `10`

### Hint Levels
Hints appear after you make your first incorrect guess.  
Different hint levels give different information, remember: hints are game-changing!  

1. `Greater or Lesser`: Shows if your guess is higher or lower than the actual number
2. `Temperature`: Shows the distance between your guess and the number by saying `Hot-Cold`
3. `Freemium Information`: Gives helpful information about the number
4. `Premium Information`: Gives less helpful information about the number but also has a 5% chance of giving the number

### Timers
There are 2 different timer types in this game you can choose from.

1. Chronometer
You can use it to measure how quick you win â€” miliseconds not included

2. Timer
You can set a timer to win before it runs out. Yes, this name caused confusions in the game-files' names.  

`40 - 60 - 100 - Custom`  

Custom choice also grants a `Help` button to help you convert minutes into seconds, don't try entering a time longer than an hour

## Setup

### Windows

Open the file named `setup.bat`. It will install the requirements and self-destruct itself.  
After that, you can delete all files that end with `.sh`.  
To start the game, open the file named `ngg.bat`. You can create a shortcut for easier access  
(but is it worth for a NUMBER GUESSING GAME?)

### Linux

Open the file named `linux_setup.sh`. It will install the requirements and self-destruct itself.  
After that, you can delete these:
- `setup.bat`
- `ngg.bat`
- `macos_setup.sh`
- `macos_ngg.sh`
To start the game, open the file named `linux_ngg.sh`.

### MacOs

Open the file named `macos_setup.sh`. It will install the requirements and self-destruct itself.  
After that, you can delete these files:
- `setup.bat`
- `ngg.bat`
- `linux_setup.sh`
- `linux_ngg.sh`
